Hi there! My name is Nathan Ballay, but feel free to call me Nate.

I'm a full-time student at RIT studying Computer Science and Game Design & Development.
I'm ultimately looking to collaboratively develop software that improves the lives of
others.

My GitHub hosts a couple of personal projects I've worked on over the years. Take a look 
around if you'd like.

If you're interested in me and my work, please reach out via any of the following channels:
